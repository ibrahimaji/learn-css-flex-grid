The default behavior of `display:flex` is the children get placed next to each other in one single row (horizontally).
`justify-content` is used to control spacing of the flex items in the direction they are placed.
Following values can be given to `justify-content` :
1. `flex-start` : All items are placed at the beginning of the container with no spaces.
2. `flex-end` : All items are placed at the end of the container with no spaces.
3. `center` : All items are placed at the center with no spaces.
4. `space-between` : All items are spaced out as much as possible with first time at the beginning and last item at the end.
5. `space-around` : Space before the flex items and after the flex items are half as much as space between the items.
6. `space-evenly` : Space before, after and between the items are same.
